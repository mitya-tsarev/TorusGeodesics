# TorusGeodesics

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook (`TorusGeodesic.nb`) that shows that geodesics on a torus with a metric induced from R<sup>3</sup> do not converge towards a "limit" geodesic around the big circle, contrary to what I believed for several years after watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfqrCdAjiks).

## Usage

To use this repository, simply download or clone it to your local machine and open the `TorusGeodesic.nb` file in Mathematica. It contains a neat interface to play with as well as a derivation of the differential equation for the geodesics.
